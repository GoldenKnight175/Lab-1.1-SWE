1) https://github.com/flutter/flutter 
	
	This seems like a very interesting take on coding since it allows you to
	run the system without having to rebuild or do anythign extra so you don't
	lose your place. It allows you to control almost everything you would need to 
	with quite relative ease, while giving feedback on how it runs. 

2) https://github.com/blueedgetechno/win11React

	I found this one quite interesting since it was a project I found that
	was advertising it's capabilities to replicate Windows 11 on the web,
	using somethings like CSS (SCSS), JS and React.

3) https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb
	
	This is quite interesting for me since it seems to make spreasheets
	a lot more understandable and smooth. This seems like the perfect 
	application for creating a more organized system without spending more 
	time understanding the confusing side. 

4) https://github.com/forem/selfhost

	This project has been founded in order to give many people the opportunity 
	to create their own free community, this can be quite complex and it is 
	almost 100% required to have backgrounds in Python 3 and other such languages and programs.

5) https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt

	The concept behind this one spoke to me, since I love Cyber security. I loved seeing that 
	it was focused on collecting and simplifying the proccess of gathering forensic information 
	that would later help down the line when it comes to identifying a device that has been
	compromised.
